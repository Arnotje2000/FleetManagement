Step 3: Switch to the Main Branch and Pull Latest Changes
git checkout main                                     # Switch to the main branch

Step 7: Check for Updates
git status                                            # Check the status of your branch against the remote

Step 8: Merge or Rebase if Necessary
If there are new changes, merge or rebase
git merge origin/main                                  # Merge changes (or use rebase if preferred)
